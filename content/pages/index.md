We are a small, faith-based 501.c.3 charitable foundation located on the shores of Southwest Michigan and established in
December of 2019. The vision for the foundation is to change the world in the best ways we can, starting with filling
niches and gaps in existing government and charitable private agencies to help meet fundamental needs for vulnerable
groups. The big plan is to address housing, employment and job skills training and services in new ways in supportive
communities. Our primary focus is on serving disabled veterans, seniors who are caught between their own private
residences and retirement communities/facilities, adults with special needs and adults returning to mainstream society
and the workforce for various reasons. Itâ€™s a huge vision, and as a new agency, we realize that we have to build our
programs carefully over time, following the direction we receive in faith.
